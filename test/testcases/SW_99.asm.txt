#This test_case tests the ability of the CPU to execute general purpose programs: 
#it initialises two objects of a struct representing complex numbers a+bi then calls the multiplication member function (a+bi)(c+di)
#The constructor reads a from $3 and b from $4 and saves the results as mem[$5] and mem[$5+4] 
#The multiplication function reads a,b,c,d from mem$[6,$6+4,$8,$8+4] and saves the results as mem[$10] and mem[$10+4] 

#initialise then multiply 4+9i and 5-3i
