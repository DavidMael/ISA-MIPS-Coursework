#test J assuming ADDIU, LW, SW, JR to be reliable
#it is my understanding that the first instruction is at BFC0...04 rather than BFC0...00,
#and that j arguments must include the entire address (divided by 4) bar the most significant hex digit, ie j 66060288 to jump to the reset bector

#the test program should see the jump skip the second instruction and give v0=6
